## Introduction:
This software lets you record the various expressions of the students like happy, sad, fear, surprise, neutral or angry which are recorded and shown in the frame. This recorded data is then saved as video for evaluation by whoever concerned.

It uses `opencv` and `tensorflow` library, and the concept of machine learning to detect the faces and their expressions respectively.

This software will help teachers to understand their students in a modern and better way, and can help even those introvert students who hesitate to any social contact. 

This will act as a bridge filling the communication gap between students and teachers. Teachers can get feedback of their class and see the students' behavior in front of them or behind their back. This will also tell the teachers which students actively participate in the classes.
